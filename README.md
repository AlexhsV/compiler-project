# Compilers Project
A programming project that was developed as a university assignment for the subject of Compilers. This project features C++ and the Flex lexical analyzer. We implement: a C++ string generator using a pushdown automaton, a C++ program that implements a top-down syntax analyzer and two lexical analyzers in Flex for sample variable and geometric shape declaration.
